## Step Mapping

| Source step | FSQ command | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `And I click "Start, home, and new tab page"` | `tapOn` | Conservative semantic conversion. |
| `When I click on "Home" button on the settings page` | `tapOn` | Conservative semantic conversion. |
| `Then the Home button should be visible on the toolbar` | `assert/assertVisible/assertWithAI` | Conservative semantic conversion. |
| `When I click on "Home" button on the settings page` | `tapOn` | Conservative semantic conversion. |

## Unresolved Or Low-Confidence Items

- Confirm Windows accessibility names against pywinauto MCP tree during first execution.

## Conversion Rules Applied

- Windows cases use `runner.backend: pywinauto-mcp` and Edge app metadata.
- Known address bar interactions use `name: Address and search bar` with `controlType: Edit`.
- Unknown UI targets are preserved as semantic `target` descriptions for accessibility-tree locator resolution.
- Screenshot/visual validation steps are represented as blocking `assertWithAI`; no visual coordinate fallback was generated.
- No coordinates were generated.

## Manual Review Checklist

- Confirm Edge executable path matches the runner machine.
- Confirm target wording is specific enough for accessibility-tree locator resolution.
- Add stable Windows locators from knowledge base when available.
- Confirm every assertion should remain blocking.
