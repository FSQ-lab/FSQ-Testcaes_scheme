## Step Mapping

| Source step | FSQ command | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Implicit conversion assumption` | `launchApp` | iOS source scenarios commonly omit explicit launch step. |
| `When I click on the search box on NTP page` | `tapOn` |  |
| `And I input a keyword "apple" in the search box` | `inputText` |  |
| `And I select the first search suggestion from the Search suggestion list` | `tapOn` |  |
| `When I dismiss the permission dialog from bing` | `tapOn` |  |
| `And I should see search results for "apple"` | `assertVisible` |  |

## Unresolved Or Low-Confidence Items

- None

## Conversion Rules Applied

- iOS scenarios without explicit launch steps receive an implicit `launchApp`.
- Known literal UI labels are converted to semantic `target` actions.
- Screenshot analysis steps are converted to blocking `assertWithAI` commands.
- Unknown UI targets are preserved as semantic `target` descriptions.
- No coordinates were generated.
- No screenshot-based coordinate guessing was used.

## Manual Review Checklist

- Confirm `appId: com.microsoft.msedge` matches the runner environment.
- Confirm target wording is specific enough for accessibility-tree locator resolution.
- Add stable iOS locators from knowledge base when available.
- Confirm every assertion should remain blocking.
